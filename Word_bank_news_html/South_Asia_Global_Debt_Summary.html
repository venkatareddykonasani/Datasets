    <h1>Summary: Unpacking South Asia’s Growing Role in Global Debt</h1>
    <p>
        The South Asia Region (SAR), comprising eight countries, represents a significant portion of the world’s population and carries a growing share of global debt. A notable increase in external debt stock and government debt-to-GDP ratio positions SAR higher than other emerging markets and developing economies in terms of debt burden. Despite this, the region has mostly avoided debt crises historically, with few countries having restructured their debt.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Half of the SAR countries are in debt distress or at high risk of it, with a total external debt stock increase of 23% in 2006 and an average government debt-to-GDP ratio of 86% in 2022.</li>
        <li>The region's long-term public and publicly guaranteed external debt nearly doubled over the last decade, emphasizing the role of the World Bank's IDA in providing support.</li>
        <li>Changes in creditor composition have been observed, with multilateral and bilateral creditors increasing their lending, while private creditor claims have declined.</li>
        <li>India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are notable for their borrowing activities, significantly contributing to the IDA's portfolio.</li>
        <li>Japan and China emerge as the largest bilateral creditors, while India also plays a crucial role as a creditor to low- and middle-income countries.</li>
        <li>The shift towards non-concessional borrowing raises concerns about debt sustainability and transparency, highlighting the potential risks from hidden debts and contingent liabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The report underscores the need for ongoing scrutiny of South Asia's fiscal trends, especially considering the potential fiscal risks amidst global economic transformations. The World Bank’s International Debt Report plays a vital role in supporting policymakers by monitoring debt trends.
